# Consistency

A setting that defines a successful write or read by the number of cluster
replicas that acknowledge the write or respond to the read request,
respectively.

## Default consistency

The default consistency is `CASS_CONSISTENCY_LOCAL_ONE`.

The default serial consistency is `CASS_CONSISTENCY_ANY`, which means no serial consistency specified.
This may result in an error upon execution of a statement that requires serial consistency (Lightweight Transaction, LWT).
In order to avoid this, you should set the serial consistency level to `CASS_CONSISTENCY_SERIAL` or `CASS_CONSISTENCY_LOCAL_SERIAL`
before executing such statement.

## Consistency Levels

### Read and Write Consistency Levels

The consistency level determines the number of replicas on which the read/write
must respond/succeed before returning an acknowledgment to the client
application. Descriptions for each read/write consistency level can be found
[here](https://docs.scylladb.com/manual/stable/cql/consistency.html).

**NOTE:** Consistency level `CASS_CONSISTENCY_ANY` is only valid for write operation statements.

## Setting Consistency Level

A ['CassStatement'](http://datastax.github.io/cpp-driver/api/struct.CassFuture/) object
can have its consistency level altered at anytime before the statement is
executed by the session.

```c
CassStatement* statement = NULL;

/* Create a simple or prepared statment */

/* Ensure the session executed statement has strong consistency */
cass_statement_set_consistency(statement, CASS_CONSISTENCY_QUORUM);

cass_statement_free(statement);
```

**NOTE:** Consistency level is ignored for `USE`, `TRUNCATE`, `CREATE` and `ALTER`
statements, and some, like `CASS_CONSISTENCY_ANY`, arenâ€™t allowed in all situations.
