# Observability

Various techniques and tools to monitor and understand the behavior of the driver and the ScyllaDB cluster it interacts with.

* [Logging](logging.md) - Emitting logs for debugging and monitoring.
* [Tracing](tracing.md) - Viewing detailed execution traces of server-side operations.
* [Metrics](metrics.md) - Collecting and exposing metrics about the driver's performance and behavior.
