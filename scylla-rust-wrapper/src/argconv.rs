/// pattern in such case. This is what we currently do - CassDataType wraps CassDataTypeInner
/// inside an `UnsafeCell` to implement interior mutability for the type.

///
/// Pointer can be either [`CConst`] or [`CMut`].

/// The semantics of this property are very simple: it tells whether
/// the pointer is const or not on the C side. If the pointer is `T*`, then
/// corresponding [`CassPtr`] is [`CMut`], and if the pointer is `const T*`, then
/// corresponding [`CassPtr`] is [`CConst`].
///
/// ## Why [`Ownership`] property is not enough?
/// This is because mutability semantics differ between C and Rust.
/// - In C/C++: mut = logically mutable, const = logically immutable
/// - In Rust: mut = exclusive ownership (e.g. Box, &mut), const = shared ownership (e.g. Arc, &)
///
/// In cpp-driver API there are some types that are both shared and mutable. Take for example `CassDataType`.
/// From rust perspective, the pointer is always [`Shared`], because it is shared behind an [`Arc`].
/// But there are some methods, e.g:
/// ```rust,ignore
/// cass_data_type_add_sub_type(CassDataType* data_type, const CassDataType* sub_data_type);
/// ```
/// which accept a mutable pointer. Such method is implemented by employing interior mutability pattern (mutating a shared object).
/// If we did not have [`CMutability`] property defined, we would not be able to
/// distinguish between `CassDataType*` and `const CassDataType*`. In such case, user would be able to obtain
/// `const CassDataType*` pointer (e.g. from `cass_tuple_data_type`) and pass it to the method that expects `CassDataType*`.

/// ## Safety and validity guarantees
/// Apart from trivial constructors such as [`CassPtr::null()`] and [`CassPtr::null_mut()`], there
/// is only one way to construct a [`CassPtr`] instance - from raw pointer via [`CassPtr::from_raw()`].
/// This constructor is `unsafe`. It is user's responsibility to ensure that the raw pointer
/// provided to the constructor is **valid**. In other words, the pointer comes from some valid
/// allocation, or from some valid reference.
///
/// ## Generic lifetime and aliasing guarantees
/// We distinguish two types of pointers: shared ([`Shared`]) and exclusive ([`Exclusive`]).
/// Shared pointers can be converted to immutable (&) references, while exclusive pointers
/// can be converted to either immutable (&) or mutable (&mut) reference. User needs to pick
/// the correct mutability property of the pointer during construction. This is yet another
/// reason why [`CassPtr::from_raw`] is `unsafe`.
///
/// Pointer is parameterized by the lifetime. Thanks to that, we can tell whether the pointer
/// **owns** or **borrows** the pointee. Once again, user is responsible for "picking"
/// the correct lifetime when creating the pointer. For example, when raw pointer
/// comes from [`Box::into_raw()`], user could create a [`CassPtr<'static, T, (Exclusive,)>`].
/// `'static` lifetime represents that user is the exclusive **owner** of the pointee, and
/// is responsible for freeing the memory (e.g. via [`Box::from_raw()`]).
/// On the other hand, when pointer is created from some immutable reference `&'a T`,
/// the correct choice of CassPtr would be [`CassPtr<'a, T, (Shared,)>`]. It means that
/// holder of the created pointer **borrows** the pointee (with some lifetime `'a`
/// inherited from the immutable borrow `&'a T`).
///
/// Both [`CassPtr::into_ref()`] and [`CassPtr::into_mut_ref()`] consume the pointer.
/// At first glance, it seems impossible to obtain multiple immutable reference from one pointer.
/// This is why pointer reborrowing mechanism is introduced. There are two methods: [`CassPtr::borrow()`]
/// and [`CassPtr::borrow_mut()`]. Both of them cooperate with borrow checker and enforce
/// aliasing XOR mutability principle at compile time.
///
/// ## Safe conversions to referential types
/// Thanks to the above guarantees, conversions to referential types are **safe**.
/// See methods [`CassPtr::into_ref()`] and [`CassPtr::into_mut_ref()`].
///
/// ## Memory layout
/// We use repr(transparent), so the struct has the same layout as underlying [`Option<NonNull<T>>`].
/// Thanks to <https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/#representation optimization>,
