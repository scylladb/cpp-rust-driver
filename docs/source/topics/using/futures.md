# Futures

Futures are returned from any driver call that would result in blocking the client application/thread. This allows the client application to continue processing and/or also submit multiple queries in succession. Although the driver has an asynchronous design, it can be used synchronously by immediately attempting to get result or explicitly waiting on the future.

## Waiting for Results

Futures results can be waited on indefinitely by either calling the `cass_future_wait()` method or by attempting to get the result with `cass_future_get_result()`. They can also be waited on for an explicit amount of time (`cass_future_wait_timed()`) or periodically polled (`cass_future_ready()`) without waiting to execute application code.

### Synchronously Waiting on the Future
```c
CassFuture* future = NULL;

/* Do some operation to get a future */

/* Block until a result or error is set */
cass_future_wait(future);

cass_future_free(future);
```

### Synchronously Waiting for the Result
```c
void wait_for_future(CassSession* session, CassStatement* statement) {
  CassFuture* future = cass_session_execute(session, statement);

  /* Blocks and gets a result */
  const CassResult* result = cass_future_get_result(future);

  /* If there was an error then the result won't be available */
  if (result == NULL) {
    /* The error code and message will be set instead */
    CassError error_code = cass_future_error_code(future);
    const char* error_message;
    size_t error_message_length;
    cass_future_error_message(future, &error_message, &error_message_length);

    /* Handle error */

    cass_future_free(future);
    return;
  }

  /* The future can be freed immediately after getting the result object */
  cass_future_free(future);

  /* Use the result object */

  cass_result_free(result);
}
```

### Timed Wait
```c
CassFuture* future = NULL;

/* Do some operation to get a future */

cass_duration_t microseconds = 30 * 1000000; /* 30 seconds */

/* Block for a fixed amount of time */
if (cass_future_wait_timed(future, microseconds)) {
  /* A result or error was set during the wait call */
} else {
  /* The operation hasn't completed yet */
}

cass_future_free(future);
```

### Polling

```c
CassFuture* future = NULL;

/* Do some operation to get a future */

/* Poll to see if the future is ready */
while (!cass_future_ready(future)) {
  /* Run other application logic or wait*/
}

/* A result or error was set */

cass_future_free(future);
```

## Callbacks

A callback can be set on a future to notify the client application when a request has completed. Using a future callback is the lowest latency method of notification when waiting for several asynchronous operations.

**Important**: The driver may run the callback on thread that’s different from the application’s calling thread. Any data accessed in the callback must be immutable or synchronized with a mutex, semaphore, etc.

**BEWARE:**: The callback code must not issue blocking operations, including waiting for a not-yet-ready future to complete. Doing so will make the driver panic, because the asynchronous executor threads (which normally execute the callbacks) must not get blocked. As a notable exception, it is allowed to call otherwise blocking future functions like `cass_future_wait()` or `cass_future_get_result()` from within the callback, but only if the future is guaranteed to be ready at that point. This is the case, among others, when calling the function on a future whose completion has triggered the callback.

```c
void on_result(CassFuture* future, void* data) {
  /* This result will now return immediately */
  CassError rc = cass_future_error_code(future);
  printf("%s\n", cass_error_desc(rc));
}

int main() {
  CassFuture* future = NULL;

  /* Do some operation to get a future */

  /* Set a callback instead of waiting for the result to be returned */
  cass_future_set_callback(future, on_result, NULL);

  /* The application's reference to the future can be freed immediately */
  cass_future_free(future);

  /* Run other application logic */

}
```
