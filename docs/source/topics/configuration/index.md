# Configuration

The following sections describe various configuration options and performance tips for the driver.

* [Load Balancing](load-balancing.md) - How the driver distributes requests across nodes in a cluster to optimize performance and availability.
* [Retries](retry-policies.md) - Handling transient errors and ensuring query reliability.
* [Speculative Execution](speculative-execution.md) - Executing requests speculatively to improve performance and reduce latency.
* [Execution Profiles](execution-profiles.md) - Grouping most common configuration settings for different execution scenarios.
* [Performance Tips](performance-tips.md) - Best practices for efficiency and how to tune the driver for optimal performance.
* [Client Identity](client-identity.md) - Configuring the client identity visible for the server.
